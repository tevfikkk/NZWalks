## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a RESTful API that allows users to:

*   View information about various walks in New Zealand.
*   Create, update, and delete walk data.
*   Securely manage user accounts and access to sensitive operations.

This API addresses the need for a centralized system to manage and access information about New Zealand walks, making it easier for hikers and other interested parties to find relevant details.
